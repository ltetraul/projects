# projects
This is a collection of class projects that I have completed during my time at Indiana University. I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Informatics and a minor in Music and am currently pursuing my master's in Sports Data Analytics here at IU Indianapolis.

I created a new metric that compares any receiver's final separation from the defense with the expected separation for the 2026 NFL Big Data Bowl: https://www.kaggle.com/code/lucastetrault/nfl-big-data-bowl-phase-3/notebook

This is my Fantasy Football Database Management System that I designed and developed using Microsoft Access: https://github.com/ltetraul/projects/tree/main/ffdb

I also worked on this interactive dashboard for a Streamlit app that looks at the connection between music and mental health: https://h501-finalproject.streamlit.app/Interactive

This is a data mining project I worked on using a NBA 2K roster dataset: https://github.com/ltetraul/projects/tree/main/DataMining2k

I designed a ticketing system application and ran usability testing for it for an HCI class: https://github.com/ltetraul/projects/blob/main/TicketPicket.pdf

This is another database I created that contains NBA player information: https://github.com/ltetraul/projects/tree/main/NBAdb

For my capstone, I developed a simple web application for my dad's renovation business. I started by cleaning up all the homeowner data that he has stored over the years and analyizing it. I then gathered my insights and displayed them on a website that also contains an interactive map that shows all of the houses he has renovated on a map: https://github.com/ltetraul/projects/tree/main/capstone
