# projects
This is a collection of class projects that I have completed during my time at Indiana University. I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Informatics and a minor in Music and am currently pursuing my master's in Sports Data Analytics here at IU Indianapolis.

I created a new metric that compares any receiver's final separation from the defense with the expected separation for the 2026 NFL Big Data Bowl: https://www.kaggle.com/code/lucastetrault/nfl-big-data-bowl-phase-3/notebook

This is my Fantasy Football Database Management System that I designed and developed using Microsoft Access: https://github.com/ltetraul/projects/tree/main/ffdb

I also worked on this interactive dashboard for a Streamlit app that looks at the connection between music and mental health: https://h501-finalproject.streamlit.app/Interactive
